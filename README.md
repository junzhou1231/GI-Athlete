# GI-InjuryNet: AI-Powered Detection and Rehabilitation for Gastrointestinal Injuries in Athletes

## 🧠 Overview

**GI-InjuryNet** is a novel AI-driven framework that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **deep learning techniques** for the **detection, classification, and rehabilitation** of gastrointestinal (GI) injuries in athletes. This project integrates **multimodal sports medicine data**—including medical imaging, biomechanical signals, physiological markers, and performance metrics—to improve injury assessment and personalized recovery planning.

## 🎯 Motivation

Gastrointestinal injuries in athletes are difficult to detect early due to their internal nature and subtle indicators. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual analysis of medical images and subjective clinical assessments, which are time-consuming and variable between observers. This project aims to:

- Enhance the **accuracy and efficiency** of GI injury detection using AI.
- Enable **personalized rehabilitation strategies** through adaptive learning.
- Reduce reinjury risks and improve long-term **athlete health outcomes**.

## 🛠️ Key Components

### 1. **Biomechanical-Aware Neural Network (BANNet)**  
- Hierarchical deep learning architecture  
- Extracts **spatial-temporal patterns** from multimodal data  
- Classifies and predicts GI injuries with high accuracy  

### 2. **Adaptive Rehabilitation and Performance Optimization Strategy (ARPOS)**  
- Reinforcement learning-based rehabilitation engine  
- Utilizes real-time **sensor feedback** and athlete performance metrics  
- Dynamically updates training protocols for **optimal recovery**  

## 🧬 Data Inputs

- 🩻 **Medical Imaging** (CT/MRI/Ultrasound)
- 📉 **Biomechanical Signals** (EMG, motion sensors)
- 💓 **Physiological Indicators** (heart rate, GI biomarkers)
- 🏃 **Athlete Performance Metrics** (speed, strength, endurance)

## 📊 Results

Our experiments show significant improvement over traditional diagnostic approaches:
- **↑ Injury detection accuracy**
- **↑ Rehabilitation efficiency**
- **↑ Clinical decision support quality**
- **↓ Reinjury rates**
